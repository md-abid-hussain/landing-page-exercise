                        Home cooks are our heroesâ€”it's as simple as that. Myrecipes is a community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will
                        dedicate the weekend to a perfect food but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The entertainers who just want a
                        solid snack spread, without tons of dirty dishes at the end of the night.
